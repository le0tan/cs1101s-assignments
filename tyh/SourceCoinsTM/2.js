// Would the greedy approach still work if the coin denominations are 1, 20, 25, and 50?
// If you think the answer is no, make the function counter_example()
// return an amount for which the greedy algorithm does not work.
// Your counter example has to be less than 100.
// If you think the answer is yes, make your function counter_example() return -1.

// You get 1 mark for making the program return a correct value.
